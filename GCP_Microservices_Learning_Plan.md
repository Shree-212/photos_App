## Success Metrics:
- [ ] Successfully deploy a multi-service application to GKE
- [ ] Implement secure inter-service communication
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging for all services
- [ ] Handle service failures gracefully
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling based on load
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Next Steps After Completion:
1. build a frontend application on next ,which uses the functionalities extended by the microservices of the test project ,and see how everything works.
2. Add advanced features like real-time notifications
3. Implement data analytics and reporting
4. Optimize for performance and cost

This learning plan will take you from GCP basics to building production-ready microservices, with hands-on experience through the test project that directly applies to your property listing application.
