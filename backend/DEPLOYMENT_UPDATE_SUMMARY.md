  - /app/node_modules
```

### 2. GCP Production Deployment

- Updated GKE deployment to wait for all 5 services
- Complete CI/CD pipeline for all microservices

**New Build Steps:**
```yaml
# Added build steps
- build-media-service
- build-notification-service

# Added push steps
- push-media-service-latest
- push-notification-service-latest

# Updated deploy waitFor
waitFor: 
  - 'push-auth-service-latest'
  - 'push-task-service-latest'
  - 'push-media-service-latest'     # NEW
  - 'push-notification-service-latest'  # NEW
  - 'push-api-gateway-latest'
```

### 3. Service Code Updates

#### Distributed Tracing Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**All Services Updated:**
- `auth-service/src/app.js`: Added SimpleTracingManager import and middleware
- `task-service/src/app.js`: Added SimpleTracingManager import and middleware
- `media-service/src/app.js`: Added SimpleTracingManager import and middleware
- `notification-service/src/app.js`: Added SimpleTracingManager import and middleware
- `api-gateway/src/app.js`: Added SimpleTracingManager import and middleware

**Integration Pattern:**
```javascript
const { SimpleTracingManager } = require('../lib/simple-tracing');

// After logger initialization
const tracingManager = new SimpleTracingManager('service-name', logger);

// Early middleware
app.use(tracingManager.createExpressMiddleware());
```

### 4. Documentation Updates

**New comprehensive setup guide including:**
- 5 microservices overview with notification service
- Email configuration requirements
- Updated service URLs and endpoints
- Distributed tracing features
- Event-driven architecture explanation
- Enhanced monitoring and debugging instructions

#### `/backend/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` ‚úÖ CREATED
**Production deployment guide including:**
- Updated GCP infrastructure setup for 5 services
- Kubernetes configuration for notification service
- Enhanced monitoring and observability setup
- Complete CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Environment-specific configurations

#### `/backend/TRACING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` ‚úÖ CREATED
**Distributed tracing documentation including:**
- SimpleTracingManager architecture
- Correlation ID propagation
- Implementation details across all services
- Usage examples and best practices

#### `/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` ‚úÖ UPDATED
**Changes:**
- Updated service count from 4 to 5 microservices
- Added notification service URL to service table

## Service Architecture Summary

### Current Service Count: **5 Microservices**

1. **üîê Auth Service** (Port 3001) - Authentication & authorization
2. **üìã Task Service** (Port 3002) - Task management with media support  
3. **üñºÔ∏è Media Service** (Port 3003) - File upload/download with image processing
4. **üìß Notification Service** (Port 3004) - **NEW** Event-driven notifications & emails
5. **üåê API Gateway** (Port 3000) - Request routing & load balancing

### Infrastructure Components

- **PostgreSQL** (Port 5432) - Primary database
- **Redis** (Port 6379) - Caching & session storage
- **Pub/Sub Emulator** (Port 8085) - Event messaging system

### New Features Integrated

1. **Event-Driven Notifications**
   - Real-time event processing via Pub/Sub
   - Email notifications with Nodemailer
   - Database-backed notification history

2. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Correlation ID propagation across all services
   - Request tracking and performance monitoring
   - Centralized logging with trace context

3. **Enhanced Observability**
   - Structured logging across all services
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Health checks and monitoring endpoints

## Local Development Workflow

### Starting the Environment
```bash
cd backend
./start-dev.sh
```

### Verifying All Services
```bash
# Check all 5 services
for port in 3000 3001 3002 3003 3004; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | jq -r .status)"
done
```

### Testing New Features
```bash
# Test notification service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test","recipient":"user@example.com"}'

# Test distributed tracing
curl http://localhost:3000/health -H "x-correlation-id: test-123"
```

## Production Deployment

### GCP Cloud Build
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl get pods -n task-manager  # Should show 5 services
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- **Email Configuration**: Required for notification service
- **Port 3004**: Now used by notification service
- **New Dependencies**: Tracing library shared across services

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# New required variables
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://notification-service:3004
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_USER=your-email
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
TRACING_ENABLED=true
```
